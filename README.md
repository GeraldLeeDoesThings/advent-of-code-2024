# Advent of Code 2024

A runner for writing Advent of Code in Rust, packaged with my solutions for 2024's problem set.

Build is exactly as expected, using `cargo build`, and similarly run with `cargo run`

The tests directory must be populated with your test cases for each day, the specifics of which can be found in the README contained in the test directory. A test with the name `N.*` will have its contents served as arguments to the solver in `src/solvers/dayN.rs`, and the resulting value will be echoed.

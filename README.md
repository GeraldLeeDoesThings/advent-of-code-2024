# Advent of Code 2024

A runner for writing Advent of Code in Rust, packaged with my solutions for 2024's problem set.

Build is exactly as expected, using `cargo build`, and similarly run with `cargo run`

The tests directory must be populated with your test cases for each day, the specifics of which can be found in the README contained in the test directory.

Currently, test cases are just echoed.
